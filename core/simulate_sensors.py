# SENSOR SIMULATOR SCRIPT
#
# This file simulates sensor readings (pressure, temperature,
# flow, vibration, humidity, and compressor status) and logs
# them into a SQLite database and a CSV file every 5 seconds.
# Itâ€™s designed to mimic real-world fluctuations and trigger
# alerts when thresholds are breached.
#
# The data from here feeds into the rest of the monitoring
# system (like anomaly detection and dashboards).
